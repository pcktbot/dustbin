# Dustbin

A collection of mostly original web design elements and experiments to aid in my personal learning.

## Install

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/pcktbot/dustbin.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Features

This was just a collection of static pages, but as of Sept 2018, it is a collection of static pages managed by an Express.js server. 

To Do
- Create generator script for taking a single argument and creating a new directory and basic static files with Express router to get there.
- Use an `fs`-type solution to keep track of all the files and create global navigation for them.
- Add markdown support to static rendering engine.
- Add PWA elements, including Service Worker, and code splitting to avoid loading everything all at once. 
- Insert shared resources into pages dynamically.
- Get your connectivity test.js running.
