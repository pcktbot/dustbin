    Long ago in a distant land, I, <span class="redacted">Aku</span>, the <span class="redacted">shape shifting</span> master <span class="redacted">of darkness</span>, unleashed an unspeakable <span class="redacted">evil</span>. But a <span class="redacted">foolish</span> samurai warrior wielding a <span class="redacted">magic sword</span> stepped forth to oppose me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the future <span class="redacted">where my evil is law</span>. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is <span class="redacted">Aku</span>.

They were called <span class="redacted">Autobots</span> and <span class="redacted">Decepticons</span>. But, the brutal <span class="redacted">Decepticons</span> were driven by a single goal, total domination.

The <span class="redacted">Autobots</span>, on the verge of extinction, battle valiantly to survive.
